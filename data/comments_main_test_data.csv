Hi Mosh thank you for yet another fantastic course. I checked through the full course and I noticed there isn’t any topic covering unit testing in this react course. I think this is a very important in modern react tool belt and would be helpful if you can look at adding it,1
This is an excellent tutorial on DevOps and encompasses all the nitty gritty of Jenkins. Really helped me a lot to understand Jenkins better. Thanks ''Simplilearn'' for the effort put into in creating this content.,1
"Start with doubts, leave with confidence。 Great Course !",1

Excellent Tutorial. Almost covered all the basics of DevOps and Jenkins. Crystal clear explanation with appropriate examples. Kudos.,1
Thank you for an excellent tutorial. Presenters talk very clear.,1
"Finally an updated version of React tutorial! I love your videos so much, but didn't want to invest in the other course since it was class based and outdated, now that you have an updated typescript function based tutorial I'm definitely buying this spring break. Keep making awesome, high quality videos mosh!",1
Great job team. This helps to quickly understand Jenkins role in DevOps.,1

So many times during this course when I got an error, I saw the hints that you gave and then tried to solve it on my own. Truly one of the best teachers!",1

"Amazing video. Lost me through a fair bit, but I came away understanding more than I ever have on the subject. Thank you.",1
"First off you are a great teacher/presenter.
Having worked in large organisations i have found one of the blockers to DevOps is that the focus tends to be primarily on Dev not Ops. That focus is also about speed and not necessarily quality. 
Unless the skills of the programmers/coders improve all we will be doing is speeding up the delivery of flawed applications.

Afterwards you feed next encoded vector with weight feed into neural network until feed all the words. So it’s like a loop, we only using on neural network. That a important point. And then we calculate the loss and use back propagation to adjust the weight and bias in our network.",1
